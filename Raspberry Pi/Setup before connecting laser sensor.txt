Enabling the I2C Interface
By default, the I2C interface on the Raspberry Pi is turned off. You must enable it before your sensor will work.

Open the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool:
Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and type:


Bash:
sudo raspi-config


Navigate to Interface Options:
Use the arrow keys to select 3 Interface Options and press Enter.

Enable I2C:
Select I5 I2C from the list and press Enter. When it asks "Would you like the ARM I2C interface to be enabled?", select <Yes> and press Enter.

Finish and Reboot:
Select <Finish> to exit the configuration tool. It will ask if you want to reboot. Select <Yes>.

After your Raspberry Pi reboots, the I2C interface will be active, and your ToF sensor will be ready to communicate with it.
